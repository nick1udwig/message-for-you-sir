# Message For You, Sir

## Purpose

You have multiple ships -- say one social ship, one group hosting ship, one software distribution ship.
It would be nice if you didn't have to check all your ships for messages.
Let's forward messages received by ships to your main ship.

How?

Create a private group.
Join it with each of your ships you wish to forward messages from, as well as the ship you will be checking messages from (say, your social ship).
Install this Gall app on each of your ships except the main one.
The app will copy messages received by these ships into the group.
